## 🔁 **User Flow (Step-by-Step)**

1. **User opens the app** → sees **Dashboard** with job list  
2. **Clicks “Add Job”** → fills form with:  
   - Company, Title, Status, City, Province, Link, Notes  
   - Clicks **[Save]** → job saved to Firebase  
3. **Dashboard updates** in real-time with new job entry  
4. **Clicks [Edit]** → form is pre-filled → user updates → clicks **[Update]**  
5. **Clicks [Delete]** → confirms → job is removed  
6. All updates handled with **React state + Firestore**  
7. Works across desktop and mobile (responsive via Tailwind)
