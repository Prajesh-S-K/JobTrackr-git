# âœ… Step 1: Key Factors to Decide Before Starting the Build

Before we create the repo or set up code, we need to clarify **what the project is**, **what it will do**, and **how it will be structured**. These foundational decisions will make the rest of the project smooth and scalable.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **1. Project Goal**
> What problem are we solving?

**Goal**: Help users keep track of job applications in one place with clear status tracking, notes, and quick access to links or updates.

---

### ðŸ”¹ **2. Target User**
> Who is the primary user?

- You (as a job seeker)
- Other students or early-career professionals
- Optional: make it multi-user later with Firebase Auth

---

### ðŸ”¹ **3. Key Features**
> What core features should the MVP (Minimum Viable Product) include?

**Core Features (MVP):**
- [ ] Add a new job application
- [ ] View a list of applications
- [ ] Edit an application
- [ ] Delete an application
- [ ] Status tracking (e.g., Applied, Interview, Offer, Rejected)
- [ ] Link to original job posting
- [ ] Notes or feedback for each job

**Optional Enhancements:**
- [ ] Filter/sort applications
- [ ] Login system (Firebase Auth)
- [ ] Dark mode or themes
- [ ] Analytics or visual progress chart

---

### ðŸ”¹ **4. Tech Stack**
> What tools/frameworks/libraries will we use?

| Area | Tool |
|------|------|
| Frontend Framework | React |
| State Management | useState/useEffect (MVP) â†’ optional: useContext or Redux later |
| Styling | TailwindCSS / CSS Modules / Material UI |
| Database | Firebase Firestore |
| Authentication (Optional) | Firebase Auth |
| Deployment | Firebase Hosting or Vercel |
| Version Control | Git + GitHub |

---

### ðŸ”¹ **5. File & Component Structure**
> How will the app be organized?

We'll cover this in the **pseudo-code layout** in the next step, but we should decide:
- Do we want a page-based layout? (yes)
- Should we split components into folders? (yes)
- Should routes be public or protected? (optional, if using auth)

---

### ðŸ”¹ **6. UI Flow Decisions**
> What pages or views will the user interact with?

Weâ€™ll map this out in a user flow in the next step too, but the initial pages could be:
- Home/Dashboard
- Add Application
- Edit Application
- View All Applications

---

### ðŸ”¹ 7. GitHub Setup Strategy
> Repo plan, commits, README goals

- Use 1 dedicated GitHub repo: `job-application-tracker`
- Clean `README.md` with a live progress checklist
- Use meaningful commit messages per segment/feature
- Link it to your **main portfolio repo** later as a project

---

### ðŸ§¾ Summary: Decisions to Finalize Before Ending Segment 1

| Decision | Finalize? |
|----------|-----------|
| Project goal and user | âœ… |
| MVP feature list | âœ… |
| Tech stack | âœ… |
| UI structure & flow | ðŸš§ (next step) |
| GitHub repo setup | ðŸš§ (next step) |
| Component/file layout plan | ðŸš§ (next step) |
